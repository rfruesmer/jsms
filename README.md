A lightweight implementation of a messaging client framework for JavaScript/TypeScript - inspired by the Javaâ„¢ Message Service API.

## Introduction

The purpose of this module is to act as an extensible platform for adding providers for different protocols into an integrated solution - it's not intended to be a complete, full-fledged message service implementation (!)

The original use case for this project was the need to combine two partly redundant messaging solutions - one being a mediator and the other being an embedded Chromium browser - into one centralized messaging service.

It can be used right out of the box in terms of an in-process mediator/event bus, but for using protocols/transports like for example STOMP over WebSocket, you have to integrate your own or other (3rd party) communication implementations by creating a custom JSMS connection class.

## Major differences compared to JMS

- JSMS is built client-first, therefore the name jsms-*client*. Although it might be run on a server as well e. g. as a Node.js application, it doesn't come with  any concrete server-side messaging implementations
  
- JSMS is not - and most probably never will be - a fully compliant implementation of the Java Message Service API specs, since JSMS targets a simplified and more lightweight approach
  
- There is no Session object - it's concept was flattened into the Connection object where appropriate
  
- JSMS doesn't target any threading/worker model (at least not for now), therefore all receive functions are asynchronous by nature using ECMAScript 2015 promises
  
- Replying to a message is facilitated by using a promise's resolve callback - no need for temporary queues or similar

## Models

The JSMS API supports both models:

- Point-to-point
- Publish/Subscribe

## Usage

Coming soon ... please refer to the JSDoc comments and tests for now.
